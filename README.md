## Running [Windows & Linux]
Currently **txAdmin is included in all FXServer builds** above 2524, so to run it for the first time simply do the following:
- Update FXServer to the latest artifact/build (2524 or superior);
- Windows: run FXServer.exe / Linux:, run `screen ./run.sh`;
- Open one of the URLs shown and configure txAdmin.

After that you could also run the `start_<build>_<profile>.bat` file created, or call it via cmd/bash if you want to edit the ConVars (ex HTTP port).  
  
txAdmin requires to be launched from *inside* FXServer in monitor mode, to do that, just execute the `run.sh` or `FXServer.exe` without **any** `+exec` arguments.  
  
### ConVars
- **serverProfile:** The name of the server profile to start. Profiles are saved/loaded from the current directory inside the `txData` folder. The default is `default`.
- **txAdminPort:** The TCP port to use as HTTP Server. The default is `40120`.
- **txAdminInterface:** The interface to use as HTTP Server. The default is `0.0.0.0`.
- **txDataPath:** The path of the data folder. The default on Windows is `<citizen_root>/../txData` and on Linux `<citizen_root>/../../../txData`.
- **txAdminVerbose:** Set to `true` to print on the console more detailed information about errors and events. The default is `false`.
  
ConVar usage **example** for different port and profile:  
```bash
# Windows
./FXServer.exe +set serverProfile dev_server +set txAdminPort 40121

# Linux
./run.sh +set serverProfile dev_server +set txAdminPort 40121
```
